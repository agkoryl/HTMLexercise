			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Painting</dt>
				<dd>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface
					(support base). <br>
					The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, <br>
					such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Source </a>
				</dd>
				<dt>Sketch</dt>
				<dd>A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work.<br>
					A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, <br>
					it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of
					graphically<br>
					demonstrating an image, idea or principle.<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Source </a></dd>
				<dt>Scrapbboking</dt>
				<dd>Scrapbooking is a method of preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the
					form of a book, box, card.<br>
					Typical memorabilia include photographs, printed media, and artwork.<a
